# codex-alias

`codex-alias` runs multiple Codex accounts/profiles with separate homes. Each
profile gets an isolated `CODEX_HOME` and a wrapper command (for example
`codex-work`) that forwards to the original `codex` binary, so auth, config, and
history stay separated.

It ships as a Python package with two parts:

- a reusable, UI-free library (`codex_alias`) that does all the filesystem work
- a `rich` + `click` CLI (`codexalias`) built on top of it

## Install

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
# One-shot install onto PATH
make install

# Equivalently, via uv directly
uv tool install .

# Or work inside the project
uv sync
uv run codexalias doctor
```

Other `make` targets: `make test`, `make sync`, `make uninstall`, `make clean`
(run `make help` for the list).

`uv tool install .` puts `codexalias` on your PATH. From there:

```bash
codexalias add work
codex-work
```

During `add`, interactive prompts let you:
1. Copy plugins/skills from the source home
2. Copy current config (`auth.json` + `config.toml`)
3. Share sessions with the root home (symlink)
4. Otherwise migrate sessions into the new profile

Pass `--no-bootstrap` to skip the prompts.

## Commands

```bash
# Create a wrapper command (default: codex-<profile>)
codexalias add <profile> [command-name]

# Import one session from default ~/.codex into current/target home
codexalias import <session-id> [target|@current]

# Repair stale provider/model metadata
codexalias fix-session <session-id> [home|@current] \
  [--provider <provider>] [--model <model>]

# Copy a session for default/another profile, then resume the copy
codexa resume <session-id> [--profile default|<profile>]

# Interactive session migration into the current home
codexalias migrate session

# Copy all sessions from one home into another
codexalias migrate copy <source|@source> [target|@current]

# Copy one session from one home into another
codexalias migrate one <source|@source> <session-id> [target|@current]

# Share sessions with a source home via symlink (existing profile)
codexalias share-sessions <profile> [source|@source]

# Run codex once with a profile (without creating a wrapper)
codexalias run <profile> [codex args...]

# List profiles
codexalias list

# Print the absolute home path of a profile
codexalias path <profile>

# Remove a profile: its wrapper command and profile data
codexalias remove <profile> [command-name]

# Keep the profile data and remove only the wrapper command
codexalias remove <profile> [command-name] --keep-data

# Environment and sanity checks
codexalias doctor
```

`@source` refers to the configured source home; `@current` refers to the current
`CODEX_HOME` (falling back to the source home when unset). A bare profile name or
an absolute path also works anywhere a home is expected.

`remove` prompts for confirmation before deleting a profile home (auth, config,
sessions, and everything else under the profile). Pass `--yes` to skip the
prompt or `--keep-data` to keep the home and only remove the wrapper. Deleting a
profile that is the configured source home or the current `CODEX_HOME` is
refused.

By default, profile commands resolve `codex` through the user's login shell, as
if `codex ...` had been entered directly. This preserves fish/bash/zsh functions
and aliases as well as PATH-based executable wrappers such as Superset. Existing
generated profile commands pick up wrapper changes automatically; refreshing
them is only necessary when the generated wrapper format itself changes.

## Environment variables

- `CODEXALIAS_PROFILE_ROOT`: profile root directory (default: `~/.codex/profiles`)
- `CODEXALIAS_BIN_DIR`: output directory for wrappers (default: `~/.local/bin`)
- `CODEXALIAS_CODEX_CMD`: original Codex command (default: `codex`)
- `CODEXALIAS_CODEX_WRAPPER`: executable Codex wrapper; takes precedence over
  `CODEXALIAS_CODEX_CMD` for `run`, `resume`, and generated profile commands
- `CODEXALIAS_CODEX_ARGS`: fixed arguments prepended to every Codex invocation
- `CODEXALIAS_SOURCE_HOME`: source home used by `add`/`@source` (default: `$CODEX_HOME` or `~/.codex`)
- `CODEXALIAS_MANAGER_BIN_NAME`: manager binary name used by generated profile commands (default: `codexalias`)

To explicitly override normal shell resolution with a standalone executable:

```bash
export CODEXALIAS_CODEX_WRAPPER="$HOME/.superset/bin/codex"
export CODEXALIAS_CODEX_ARGS="--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox"
codexa resume <session-id>
```

The explicit override must be an executable name or path. Without it, shell
aliases and functions are inherited automatically.

## Library usage

The core is importable and never prints or exits — it returns value objects or
raises `CodexAliasError` subclasses, so you can drive it from your own tooling:

```python
from codex_alias import CodexAlias, Config

mgr = CodexAlias(Config.from_env())
mgr.add_profile("work")

for profile in mgr.list_profiles():
    print(profile.name, "shared" if profile.sessions_shared else "isolated")

# Copy one session between homes
src = mgr.resolve_home_ref("@source").path
dst = mgr.resolve_home_ref("work").path
result = mgr.copy_session_by_query(src, "019d1df0-8f1e-7393-b54a-0f0b511c5a33", dst)
print(result.status)
```

## Session sharing

By default each profile has isolated sessions. To share history across profiles
(useful when different provider configs access the same conversations), share
sessions during creation (answer yes to "Share sessions with root home") or for
an existing profile:

```bash
codexalias share-sessions work
```

This symlinks `~/.codex/profiles/work/sessions` (plus `history.jsonl` and the
`state_5.sqlite` / `logs_1.sqlite` metadata databases) to the source home, so
sharing profiles see the same conversation history while keeping separate
auth/config. Existing real files are backed up to `*.backup.N` before being
replaced with a symlink.

## Repairing a session

Codex persists model-provider and model metadata both inside each JSONL session
and in the `state_5.sqlite` thread index. If a provider is later renamed or a
profile uses a different model, `codex resume` can fail before the TUI starts.
Repair both persisted copies with:

```bash
# Preview the repair; "custom" is inferred from ~/.codex/config.toml
codexalias fix-session 019f8938-544e-7160-901c-af1ffb2657a5 --dry-run

# Apply it, but only where the stale value is exactly "aicoding"
codexalias fix-session 019f8938-544e-7160-901c-af1ffb2657a5 \
  --from-provider aicoding \
  --model deepseek-v4-pro
```

The command validates every JSONL record before writing, creates unique
`*.backup.N` copies for changed JSONL and SQLite files, atomically replaces the
JSONL, and conditionally updates only the matching SQLite thread row. Use
`--provider` to override the provider inferred from the selected home's
top-level `model_provider` setting, and `--model` to repair the persisted model
as well.

## Resuming with another profile

`codexa resume <session-id>` shows a numbered Rich list containing
`default` and every added profile. After the profile is selected, it asks
whether to fix the copied session's provider and model. A `y` reads both
values from the target profile's top-level `config.toml`, repairs the new
session's JSONL and SQLite metadata, and then launches Codex. An `n` keeps the
existing behavior and leaves the copied model unchanged. The source session is
never modified. This also works when profiles share session storage through
symlinks because the cloned session has a distinct ID.

The clone also applies registered response-item compatibility mappings,
regardless of the fix prompt. The current `gpt-5*` rule clears non-empty
plaintext `reasoning.content`; GPT-5 Responses endpoints reject that replay
shape. Rules use model and wire-API capabilities, not hard-coded provider
names.

Encrypted history has a separate portability boundary. Codexalias compares a
normalized `wire_api + base_url` backend fingerprint when both sides are known.
It preserves encrypted reasoning for aliases of the same backend, drops foreign
encrypted reasoning as an explicitly reported lossy mapping, and does not guess
when either backend is unknown. Foreign encrypted compaction blocks the repair
because deleting it could remove the only copy of earlier context. Incomplete
or orphan historical tool calls are reported as diagnostics but are not changed.
Add future rules to `src/codex_alias/session_mappings.py` and classify each one
as lossless or lossy.

Use `--profile cpa` to skip the profile picker or `--no-launch` to create the
copy without starting Codex. The fix confirmation is still shown after the
profile is known. The installed executable names are `codex-alias`, `codexa`,
and `codexalias`.
